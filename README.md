GitHub's native interface does not provide a direct XML rendering feature, so there are limited options for previewing XML files on GitHub without using external tools or extensions. Here are the main ways you can work with XML files on GitHub:

View as Plain Text: When you open an XML file on GitHub, it will typically be displayed as plain text. You can see the raw XML content, but it won't be formatted or highlighted for readability.

Third-Party Browsers Extensions: As previously mentioned, browser extensions like "Octotree" or "Enhanced GitHub" can improve your GitHub experience by providing better rendering for various code files, including XML.

Online XML Parsers: You can use online XML parsing tools to view and format XML files from GitHub. Follow these steps:

a. Copy the URL of the XML file on GitHub.

b. Visit an online XML parsing tool like "https://jsonformatter.org/xml-viewer" or similar.

c. Paste the URL of the XML file into the online tool, and it will parse and display the XML content in a more structured format.

Local XML Editors: For more advanced XML editing and viewing, you can use local XML editors like Visual Studio Code with XML extensions, Notepad++, or dedicated XML editors such as Oxygen XML Editor. These tools provide a more user-friendly XML viewing and editing experience on your local machine.
